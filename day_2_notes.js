// Git
// Version control system designed to keep chronological timeline of all of your code changes.
/*To travers file system in terminal:
cd name_of_folder moves you down
cd .. moves you up
ls lists items inside the folder
pwd specifies directory path you're currently in

To initiate a git repository
1) git init
2) Staging files for a commit - git add <file_name> OR git add . (to add all files in folder)
git status - tells us the status of our repository
git reset can convert back before committing to the repository if for some reason we don't want to commit all the files
git commit -m "type commit message here to provide short explanation of changes made"
